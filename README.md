# webScraperMP-Challenge
A script which searches information on a website and saves the found information into a json-file.
Used librarys: BeautifulSoup, requests, simplejson.

Time invested preparing, incorporating into Python and the librarys for this project: 3.30h
I added in some unit testing of which 4 out of 5 tests run successfully: 20 min. 

Total time invested ~4 hours

fun idea to start learning python with a web scraping script.
